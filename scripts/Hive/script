1.  Count of enteries for each state(LocationDesc) and sorted by state
select locatiodesc, count(chol) from dataset group by locatiodesc order by locatiodesc;

2. Count the number of entries for each Topic and sort it by count
select value , Topic from (select count(*) as value, Topic from dataset group by Topic ) a order by value;
